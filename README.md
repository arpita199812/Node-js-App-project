6. After cloning the repo on ubuntu server then go into that repo by - cd Node-js-App-project/
7. ls - get all the file under it, then make .env file and setup the file by give port and publishable and secret key, which you can create in stripe official website.

2. Setup the following environment variables - `(.env)` file
```
DOMAIN= ""
PORT=3000
STATIC_DIR="./client"

PUBLISHABLE_KEY=""
SECRET_KEY=""
```
> For this project, we'll have to set up an [Elastic IP Address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) for our EC2 & that would be our `DOMAIN`

3. Initialise and start the project
```
npm install
npm run start
```

> NOTE - We will have to edit the **inbound rules** in the security group of our EC2, in order to allow traffic from our particular port

### Project is deployed on AWS ðŸŽ‰
